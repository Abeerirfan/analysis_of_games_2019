    "A large part of our job as data analysts in a mobile game company like King consists of analysing data from people playing the game. We call this **post-hoc analysis**. However, when you are designing a new game, we don't have any real data to look at! How do we know if the game is designed properly? Is it too easy or too hard? Are we giving away too many or too few boosters? Does the game have enough levels to keep the players busy until we have new content? If we wait for real data to answer these questions, we are too late and will have already lost players. So how do we answer these questions, before the game is released to players? That is when we rely on **data simulation**."
